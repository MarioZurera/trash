CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/maniel73/programming/C/trash/cmake-build-debug/_deps/googletest-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/maniel73/programming/C/bash/cmake-build-debug/_deps/googletest-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
